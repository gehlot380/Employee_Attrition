Employee Attrition Prediction using machine learning

Author : Neha Gahlot

Project Goals

Attrition in human resources refers to the gradual loss of employees over time. A major problem in high employee attrition is its cost to an organization. An organization invests a lot of time and money to recruit and train its employees as per the business need. Along with time and money, the organization also loses its valuable employees that can affect productivity. Not just this, the organizations further need to invest in recruitment, training, and development of new staff to fill up their vacant positions.
The main objectives of this project is to analyze different factors that alter the attrition rate and provide quality insights and suggestions to retain the employees. Along with this, accurately predict whether an employee of a company will leave or not using different classification models.

Data Description

The dataset consists of 35 attributes with 1470 observations that contribute towards employee attrition. All variables are related to an employeeâ€™s personal characteristics like age, gender, marital status, etc. along with professional traits such as salary, department, job role, etc.

Method used : Random Forest Classifier and Naive Bayes

Approach

1)Pre-processing of the dataset
2)Descriptive analysis
3)Model Building
4)Validation and comparison of model

Conclusion

This project presented the importance of employee attrition prediction in any organization. The results of this study showed the superiority of the Random Forest Classifier in terms of accuracy and predictive effectiveness. Random Forest Classifier predicted 89.7% of employees to leave an organization.
This is considered as good accuracy as compared to that of Naive Bayes having an accuracy of 83.6%.
